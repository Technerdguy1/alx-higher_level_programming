High Level Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms
   -----------------

Higher-level programming, Data Structure & algorithms was one of the core Curriculum/projects done during my `Full Stack Software Engineering studies` at **ALX_Africa/Holberton_School.**
The language of chioce for this project is **Python Programming Language**.

Zen
 --------
| [The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters] |
| ---- |
|Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! |

Tecnologies
   -----------------
 - All Shell scripts were written using GNU bash, version `5.0.17(1)`
 - All Python scripts were written and interpreted/compiled using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
 - All files were tested using `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
 - Python files are written according to the pycodestyle `2.11.1`

The following directories contained are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [0x00-python-hello_world](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world) | Introduction to python programming Language. How to use the Python interpreter, How to print text and variables using print, How to use string, What are indexing and slicing in Python, and What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle.|
| [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | Why Python programming is awesom, Why indentation is so important in Python, How to use the `if, if ... else` statements, How to use comments, How to affect values to variables, How to use the `while` and `for` loops, etc. |
| [0x02. Python - import & modules](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules) |This Project is aimed at learning how to: import functions from another file; use imported functions; create a module; use the built-in function `dir()`; prevent code in your script from being executed when imported, and use command line arguments with your Python programs. |
| [0x03-python-data_structures](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-python-data_structures) | This Project is aimed at learning about: What are lists and how to use them; What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists; What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them; How to use lists as stacks and queues; What are list comprehensions and how to use them; What are tuples and how to use them; When to use tuples versus lists; What is a sequence; What is tuple packing; and What is the del statement and how to use it. |
| [0x04-python-more_data_structures](0x04-python-more_data_structures) | The project aims is to learn about; Data Structure; Lambda, Filter, Reduce, and Map |
| [0x05. Python - Exceptions](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-python-exceptions) | The project aims is to learn about: Errors and Exceptions; What’s the difference between errors and exceptions;What are exceptions and how to use them; When do we need to use exceptions; What’s the purpose of catching exceptions; How to raise a builtin exception, and When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception. |
| [0x06-python-classes](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-python-classes) | The project aims is to learn about: OOP, “first-class everything$, How to print text and variables using print, How to use strings, What are indexing and slicing in Python.
What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle |
