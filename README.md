High Level Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms
   -----------------

Higher-level programming, Data Structure & algorithms was one of the core Curriculum/projects done during my `Full Stack Software Engineering studies` at **ALX_Africa/Holberton_School.**
The language of chioce for this project is **Python Programming Language**.

Tecnologies/Requirments
   -----------------
 - All Shell scripts were written using GNU bash, version `5.0.17(1)`
 - All Python scripts were written and interpreted/compiled using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
 - All files were tested using `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
 - Python files are written according to the pycodestyle `2.11.1`

| Filename | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [0x00-python-hello_world](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world) | Introduction to python programming Language. How to use the Python interpreter, How to print text and variables using print, How to use string, What are indexing and slicing in Python, and What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle.|
| [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | Why Python programming is awesom, Why indentation is so important in Python, How to use the `if, if ... else` statements, How to use comments, How to affect values to variables, How to use the `while` and `for` loops, etc. |
| [0x02. Python - import & modules]() |This Project is aimed at learning how to: import functions from another file; use imported functions; create a module; use the built-in function `dir()`; prevent code in your script from being executed when imported, and use command line arguments with your Python programs. |
