Python - import & modules
   ----------------
This Projects were done during **Full Stack Software Engineering Study @ Alx_Africa/Holberton_School** and aimed at learning the following;
 - Why Python programming is awesome.
 - How to import functions from another file.
 - How to use imported functions
 - How to use the built-in function `dir()`
 - How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported.
 - How to use command line arguments with your Python programs.

Technologies and Requirements
  ------------------
 - All Shell scripts were written using GNU bash, version 5.0.17(1)
- All Python scripts were written and interpreted/compiled using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
 - All files were tested using `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
 - Python files are written according to the `pycodestyle 2.11.1`

Files
  -------------------
The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
